# Samples.WeatherForecast

Following the tutorial set out by Peter King in [API's From Dev to Production](https://dev.to/newday-technology/api-s-from-dev-to-production-428i). But I'm doing on an üçè Mac.

## How I got here

```zsh
mkdir Samples.WeatherForecast
cd Samples.WeatherForecast
touch Readme.md
code .
```

Updated README.md

```zsh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Ready player one!"
```
